# Metric/Imperial Unit Converter with Theme Switcher

This project is a simple web application that converts between metric and imperial units. The main focus of this project was to implement a theme switcher and practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

You can access the live version of the project [here](https://dynamicunitconverter.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Converts between metric and imperial units for length, volume, and mass
- Dynamic theme switching between light and dark modes
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Main Objectives

1. **Theme Switching**: Implement a toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. This feature demonstrates the ability to dynamically change the appearance of a web page using JavaScript.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: Practice manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. This includes changing styles, updating content, and handling user interactions.

3. **Event Handling**: Implement event listeners to respond to user actions such as clicking the theme toggle switch and interacting with the conversion button.

4. **Code Organization**: Structure the JavaScript code in a clear and maintainable way, separating concerns and using functions effectively.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Implementing dark mode functionality in a web application
- Dynamically updating styles using JavaScript
- Organizing JavaScript code for better readability and maintainability
- Handling user interactions and updating the UI accordingly

## Future Improvements

- Add more unit conversion options
- Implement local storage to remember user's theme preference
- Enhance accessibility features

Feel free to explore the code and suggest any improvements!
